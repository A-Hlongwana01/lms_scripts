SCRIPTS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR LMS - FOR WTC STUDENTS

FOR DEBIAN DISTROS BUT SHOULD WORK ON MOST OS WITH SOME CONFIG


After cloning or downloading...

1. Open the lms_scripts directory with your text editor of choice

2. In the "dist" directory - open and edit the following 2 files:
   
   - lms (swap "keycloak password here" with your real keycloak password you use to login to LMS)

   - install (swap "your sudo password here" with the username password you use to login to your computer or laptop)




Then open your terminal and run the following commands

1. cd ~/lms_scripts

2. ./install


All should be good to go after this.
